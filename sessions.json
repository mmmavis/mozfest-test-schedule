We will also spend time coming up with other ideas to encode and enforce privacy protections and preference settings into products. Mozilla first implemented the ability to signal DNT:1 to the world in 2011.

The only information available on the mesh will be the information contained on your device. We'll start off with just 2 hand-held wireless routers as mesh points, and add more as the group expands. Eventually the mesh could grow as large as the entire conference area, with people sharing information in a secure and decentralized fashion unlike any form of networking they might be used to. We'll use the mesh network in this simulated Internet blackout to get people thinking about the need to create decentralized and citizen-built networks. In the “Let’s Build an Unbreakable Internet” activity, you will use off-the-shelf hardware to build an isolated wireless mesh network. This works by connecting multiple wireless access points together, and then routing traffic across them. During periods of civil unrest like the Arab Spring, civilians organized and spoke openly on social media, and subsequently the involved governments sought to limit access to the internet. In a typical model with an ISP, this is as easy as cutting a cord. Mesh networking doesn't allow for this because it's never reliant on a single point of access, it heals itself if a point in the mesh goes down, access to local resources on the mesh always remains open, it’s open source and freely available, and accessible by anyone with WiFi. This session will introduce you to the concept, and teach you how to create one yourself.",

The objective of this session is giving the participants knowledge about concepts behind  privacy enhancing software and encryption tools.  This is a human centered approach to privacy tools - improve the users' mental model of the software and they will have a better idea of how it works. You will learn how privacy enhancing tools work through role-playing, group activities, and playing out scenarios. We will start off with a discussion about privacy concerns people have with online activities. We also want to empower the participants to regain some control of their online activities.  To re-enforce this taking control, we will use the \"Stop, Start, Keep\" process. Join us to share your start/stop/keeps. #PRIVACYSTART.  Everyone is entitled to communicate privately, and securely. Learn how Off the Record IM encryption works, how the TOR Browser works, and how asymmetric encryption (like PGP) works.  This session will also offer practical advice and guides for anyone to self-host their own email, websites and share files securely without relying on a single large infrastructure provider like Google or Amazon (but it will work with them too).  everyone should understand how their private, personal data is now at risk of being shared with third parties without their knowledge. Hosting your own email, websites and file sharing can help reduce that risk.If you can use a computer, you can host your own email in as little as five steps using free/libre open source software (FLOSS).",

Patterned like a giant working group, we will identify and create free resources and tools that are designed specifically to help school systems navigate the complex terrain of student data privacy. However, in contrast to a lecture-style presentation, our discussion will evolve organically as participants weigh in and personally respond to questions about how we can help schools use new education technology with confidence that they understand what student data is collected and how it is used and stored.

It was largely a Maker Party as well as a Festival helps to bring together several great minds from all fields like tech, gaming, open data to brain storm and come up with solutions to current challenges facing the developing world.

Community members collaborate for change, and raise important questions about how to allow this to take place in a respectful and inclusive manner, and what governance structures and consultation processes best support this ecosystem.\n\nBeing distributed and collaborative is exciting and enriching for both ourselves and our projects but also poses us with significant challenges that we have struggled to effectively resolve. \nWe'll discuss about these, focusing on Global Community Processes, Cultural, Gender, Age and Accessibility & Ability diversity. Working groups unpacking each topic will aim to learn from the most relevant learnings and resources available and flesh out their proposals for the next steps that could help the Open Web movement to be more inclusive and therefore stronger.\n\nThis proposal builds on the discussions and learnings from two previous workshops, run at re:publica (Berlin, May 2014) and Wikimania (London, August 2014).\n\n[Click here to go to the updated etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/cb-diversity)",
